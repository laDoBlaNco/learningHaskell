# HASKELL: DATA ANALYSIS MADE EASY
Udemy course for using Haskell for data analysis. I'll be using this to broaden my 
knowledge of using haskell in the wild and in real world situations and using haskell
for real-world data sets, graphs and visualizations. Everything from basics to clusters
and regression methodologies.
